QuickJump
=========

QuickJump allows you to bookmark directories and switch between them easily.
It's like a URL shortener but it's designed for your local machine.

Supported platforms
-------------------

I tried it under Linux only. It works with Bash and ZSH too. I think it
should also work under Mac OS.
